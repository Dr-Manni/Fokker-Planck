In the folder SQRA there is a MATLAB script to generate the eigenvectors
by Square root approximation.

go to msm/fff0 and run "make" in a terminal
to compile a run the software. It produces a trajectory and generates the
counting matrices to build the msm.

The Ipython Notebook msm/Results.ipynb contains a few lines of code to produce the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the counting matrices
